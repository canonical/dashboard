  Dashboard is a Django-based web application to track quality and progress across multiple dimensions, for multiple projects.

  Based on https://github.com/canonical/dashboard; for this charm, see the charmed-version branch.

config:
  options:
    stripped-prefix:
      description: |
        Enable this option when the ingress frontend strips the path prefix before passing requests to the application. 
        For example, if you are using the nginx-ingress-integrator and set the following configuration:
        juju config nginx-ingress-integrator path-routes='/documentation(/|$)(.*)' rewrite-enabled='True' rewrite-target='/$2'
        in this case, set this configuration option to `/documentation`. 
        This is a temporary solution until the dashboard Django application supports multiple teams. 
        This configuration option may be removed in the future.

    force-https:
      type: boolean
      description: >-
        Enable this option when the ingress frontend is unaware that the application is served over HTTPS instead of 
        HTTP. This will make the dashboard application enable settings that assume the application is exposed over 
        HTTPS, regardless of what the upstream ingress returns in the ingress URL.
        It may cause some unforeseeable ingress issues, so avoid using this option if possible.
