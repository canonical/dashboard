  Dashboard is a Django-based web application to track quality and progress across multiple dimensions, for multiple projects.

  Based on https://github.com/canonical/dashboard; for this charm, see the charmed-version branch.

  options:
    stripped-prefix:
      description: |
        Enable this option when the ingress frontend strips the path prefix before passing requests to the application. 
        For example, if you are using the nginx-ingress-integrator and set the following configuration:
        juju config nginx-ingress-integrator path-routes='/documentation(/|$)(.*)' rewrite-enabled='True' rewrite-target='/$2'
        in this case, set this configuration option to `/documentation`. 
        This is a temporary solution until the dashboard Django application supports multiple teams. 
        This configuration option may be removed in the future.
